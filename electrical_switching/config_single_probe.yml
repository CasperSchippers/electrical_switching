# Configuration file for electrical switching experiments:
#
# In rows, define which rows are connected to: "ground", "pulse high",
# "pulse low", "lock-in input A", "lock-in input B", "lock-in output"
#
# In columns, define an entry for each pulse and probe configuration
# (i.e. columns: pulsing: pulse 1; pulse 2; etc. and columns: probing:
# probe Rxx1; probe Rxy1; probe Rxx2). Note that the pulses and probes
# might be ordered alphabetically during the measurements.
# 
# Pulses have properties "high" and "low", probes have properties
# "current high", "current low", "voltage high", and "voltage low"
# Additional parameters (for pulses: "number of bursts", "length", "amplitude", and for probes: "sensitivity", "frequency", "time-constant",
# "duration")
